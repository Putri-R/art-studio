Under the guidance of experienced instructors, you'll learn the fundamentals of ballet technique, from pli√©s to pirouettes. As you progress, you'll have the opportunity to master more complex movements and choreograph your ballet routines. The beauty of ballet lies in its ability to instill discipline and control, which carries over into all aspects of life.

Hip-Hop is a dance form that breathes life into the urban streets and music. This dynamic and energetic style is known for its powerful moves, rhythmic beats, and self-expression.
